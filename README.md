## [Jallu Index](https://github.com/jonitaajamo/Reaktor-code-golf/blob/master/code/alko.py)
Our implementations character count: 85

The code fetches current price of Jaloviina from Alko’s site ( https://www.alko.fi/tuotteet/000706/Jaloviina-/ ), parses it and gives it as an output. The price must be fetched from Alko’s site, you can’t just hard code it to print out the current price ;-)

#### Input
Nothing.

#### Example Output
16,99
